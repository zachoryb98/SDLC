# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
This course helped me to reinforce the idea that interpretting user needs can come in through feedback and system analysis. If we have people that are using our software or have an idea of some software they want created, they will have ideas that can most likely be translated to software. This is where user stories can come into play. The product owner of your development team can request additional feedback from customers to create a product vision. This vision allows the idea of features and user stories to come to life by giving the development team the perspective of the customer by creating requirements. After the team reviews the user story they can chop it up into tasks and provide incremental amounts of software to achieve the goal.
